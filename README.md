- firstly, download the file, then open a terminal with the root folder (where the Main.java file is) as the directory
- then run `javac -cp "lib/jl1.0.1.jar" Main.java` in the terminal to compile the program with the necessary dependency, which is included automatically in the lib folder
- and to start the program, run `java -cp ".;lib/jl1.0.1.jar" Main`

to add your own songs, just put the .mp3 file (it has to be .mp3) in the Songs folder, and it should autodetect. there are already some placeholder songs there that you can play
